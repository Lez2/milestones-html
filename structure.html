    <h1>The Structure of an HTML</h1>
    <p>An HTML is the core content of most webpages. The file itself is split into two sections. There is a Head and Body.
      Indicators of each section are surrounded by less-than and greater-than bracket. Tags are closed with /TagName. The
      head carries metadata for the website like the character set used and the name of the website displayed on yout
      internet browser tab. The body tab contains everything displayed on the webpage and links to any java script. </p>
    <h2>Body Tags</h2>
    <p>There are several body tags. Some effect the size of text and sytle of text. Other allow you to add multimedia and links to other webpages.
      These will be discussed in-depth in other webpages.
